# An Illumination-Aware Network for Camouflaged Object Detection with Bio-Inspired Visual Processing

Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that closely blend into the background in terms of color, texture, shape, and other visual characteristics. However, existing methods still face challenges in handling background complexity, the inherent ambiguity of camouflaged objects, and their low contrast with surrounding regions. It is noteworthy that owls can locate prey in environments with extremely low illumination, primarily due to the unique distribution of photoreceptors in their retina and the efficient hierarchical visual processing mechanism. Inspired by this, this paper proposes an illumination-aware network (IANet) to address these challenges by systematically simulating the photosensitive enhancement and signal processing mechanisms of the owl’s visual system. Specifically, to simulate the owl’s exceptional light sensitivity and contrast perception, we designed a new HVIC color space, which is embedded in the network as a photosensitive cue to enhance the model’s information extraction capabilities under complex lighting conditions. Furthermore, we modeled the processing pathway of owl visual signals from the retina to the higher-level nerve center and constructed three core modules: the photoreceptor encoder, which extracts multi-scale light-sensitive features and RGB features; the neural signal processor, which simulates the information integration and screening mechanism of the biological intermediate nerve layer; and the central guidance decoder, which performs top-down attention modulation and precise target positioning. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that IANet surpasses 29 state-of-the-art methods, achieving the best results on 13 of 16 evaluation metrics and ranking second on the remaining three. Moreover, IANet exhibits strong cross-domain generalization across concealed crop detection, camouflaged plant detection, salient object detection, and polyp segmentation, etc. 

This work has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence. After the paper is accepted, we will release the experimental code.
